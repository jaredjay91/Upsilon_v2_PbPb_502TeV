II. Skim the data

Run Skimming/condor/SkimRDTree_raw_GetAverageQ_noDataset.C on lxplus using the condor config files condorExec_raw_GetAverageQ.sh and condorConfig_raw_GetAverageQ.sub. This skim also calculates the average cosines and sines needed for recentering later.


III. Recenter the q vectors.

Run Skimming/condor/SkimMMTree_recentering_GetAverageEP_nords.C to create a new skim with recentered q vectors and event plane angle.


IV. Flatten reaction plane angle

Add some pre-determined quantity to each reaction plane angle to make the distribution flat. This is done using Skimming/condor/SkimMMTree_flatten_GetResCor_nords.C, which takes the mean values of cos(Psi) and sin(Psi) from the previous skim and uses them in the flattening equation to create a new flattened dataset.


V. Calculate resolution correction

The resolution correction is automatically calculated while flattening in the last skim. It is applied the extracted v2 values later.


VI. Calculate acceptance and efficiency corrections.

Calculate the acceptance versus pt by running Corrections/Acceptance/getAcceptanceFrom19001Skim.C on the data file /afs/cern.ch/user/g/goni/public/Acceptance/skimedForAcc/skimedForAcc_MC_Ups1S_20170808.root. This file was used in the code for AN-19-001.


VII. Make the RooDataSet

Run makeRooDataset.C on the latest flattened dataset. Be sure to include the acceptance and efficiency corrections as weights in the new RooDataset.


VIII. Fit the data

Use the code in the SignalFitting directory.


IX. Extract signals

Use v2Fitting/GetYieldsvsPhi.C to extract the yields from the fits and put them into histograms versus dphi for each kinematic bin. GetAllYieldsVsPhi.C does this automatically for every bin.


X. Calculate v2

Use v2Fitting/Fitv2.C to fit the yield versus dphi histograms to extract a value for v2 in that kinematic bin. Get_v2_vs_var.C does this for every bin and outputs histograms of v2 versus the variable of interest. Apply resolution corrections.


XI. Estimate systematic uncertainties

1. Due to method of applying acceptance corrections: Apply different (unweighted) corrections.
2. Due to method of estimating efficiency corrections: Apply different (unweighted) corrections.
3. Due to choice of signal pdf: Use an alternative signal pdf.
4. Due to choice of background pdf: Use an alternative background pdf.
5. Due to constraining signal parameters: Constrain to different values.
6. Due to flattening procedure: Don't flatten.


XII. Plot the results, including systematic uncertainties.


XIII. Perform MC closure test.
